Our data is a table where each column is an ICD-10 class, and each row is a patient presence/absence vector.

We can, using the pure ICD-10 Structure, create an graph representation of the relationship in the form of the classification tree itself:

[ICD-10 tree](/red-tree/pages/icd10_tree.html)

We can also represent the relationships between diseases determined by a disease x disease pairwise similarity measure applied to the data:

[Similarities](/red-tree/pages/similarities.html)

Or we can combine these:

[Hybrid graph](/red-tree/pages/icd10_tree_sims.html) (tree)

[Hybrid graph](/red-tree/pages/hybrid_plot.html) (repulsion)
